Joining a Bootcamp in efforts to learn how to code with Ruby is probably one of the most intimidating things I've ever decided to attempt in my life. I figured it wouldn't be too hard though seeing as how I've had prior experience coding using other programming languages like HTML, CSS and JAVA.  Boy was I wrong...

Learning how to code in ruby was an expeirence of its own and by time I got to the first Final Project, I was confused beyond measure. "*Where do I start? How do I start? How will I know when I'm done? Wait... What are we doing again?"*.. LOL. Thankfully I soon found out that I wasn't the only one experiencing these feelings of doubt and confusion.  It was my etire class!  And luckily there were many resources we could use to literally walk us through the process of creating our first Ruby gem(s).

After getting a bit of coaching, direction, and watching a few videos on the matter, I quickly began to understand what It was we were actually doing and was set on my idea for the project. All of the puzzle pieces started to form together from previous lessons and before you know it, I was creating my first program with a Command Line Interface! How Exciting! I chose to create a program that presents a list of top singers, then gives more info on an indiviual singer based on the user's input.

I found that the way you "WIN", complete a task, or accomplish a goal is to focus on What's Important Now (W.I.N.). Using this approach to development, I was able to tell my program what it is I want to do first, then build the code aroud it. Creating my environment, CLI controller, and executable file was my starting point.  Once those were built, I was able to create logic inside my controller and litterally tell my program, step-by-step, "this is what I want to do". I was on fire at this point!

Eventually moving on to creating objects, breaking and refactoring my code, I was impressed with all that had learned so far, and was even able to find errors and help my classmates understand their logic. Once my project was complete, I was filled with joy and accomplishment. I know that I still have much to learn, but this first gem gave me all the cofidence to continue on!
