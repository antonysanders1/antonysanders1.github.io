*"Finally.. coding web apps!"* This was litterally my first thought once I had made it to the second mod of my curriculum here at Flatiron. I was filled with such excitement and giddy that I couldn't conatin myself.  After learning the basics of Sinatra, and prior gaining an understanding of Ruby, HTML, CSS, SQL and more, it wowed me that coding simple webs apps could be so easy. I figured it would be much more complex. And the crazy thing is, I hear it gets even easier with other frameworks like Ruby on Rails!... But let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet.

So Sintra, what is it anyway? Sinatra is a domain-specific language written in Ruby, that depends on the Rack web server interface. If I broke down that last sentence, we'd be here for quite some time, just know that its a framework that was designed to support the development of dynamic websites and web apps. Learning about it was more tasking than actually learning it in my opnion, and everthing up to this point in the curriculum gave me confidence that I could build my first web app.
