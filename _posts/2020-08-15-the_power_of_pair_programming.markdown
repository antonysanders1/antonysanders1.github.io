With so many resources publicly available available on the internet today, it's pretty easy to learn how to code. Whether you choose to fight through the noise of Google searching, watching videos on YouTube, or choose the more structured route by joining a boot camp with the set curriculum, becoming a developer is far from out of reach. But when it comes to sharpening our skills as a developer, there's one strategy that stands out the most to me. Pair programming.
But what exactly is pair programming? Pair programming is a software development technique in which two (or more) programmers work together on a single project - hence the name. In the past this was typically done on a single machine while one person codes and the other observes, but advancements in technology over the past decade have allowed us to slightly alter these methods and in a great way. I'll be going over what I believe are some of the best pair programming styles to help boost your programming skills!


**Driver Navigator:**

First up is the driver navigator style. This is arguably one of the most used and productive styles in pair programming, and for good reason. The name derives from the functional relationship that drivers and navigators share. Drivers are responsible for the mechanics out of the vehicle like turning the wheel and pressing on the gas, while the navigator is more focused on when and how we reach our destination. Comparably in programming the driver would be the person who actually writes the code while the navigator would be the one focused on the big picture while also checking for mistakes. The benefits here whether you, as the junior developer, are the driver or navigator, is that this method teaches you valuable error checking methods, how to talk through your code, and learn best coding practices (especially when paired with a senior engineer).


**Tour guide:**

In this particular pair programming style there's what you could consider a tour guide and a tourist. We'll use a Segway tour as our example here to modernize this style. A tour guide is typically responsible for not only the mechanical side like showing you how to maneuver a Segway, maneuvering his own Segway and navigating through the streets wow showing you all of the cool things the city has to offer. Comparatively, pairing with a senior engineer and having them show you how write code on their machine, while you follow along on your own machine is just the same. During this tutorial (or tour) you have the ability to ask questions and receive answers. You could also watch a tutorial and the person who made it tutorial would the tour guide in this scenario. The only drawback here is that you can't ask immediate questions without leaving a comment and hoping to receive an answer.


**Ping-Pong:**

Next up is ping-pong pair programming. Say that five times fast. Now this isn't a personal favorite style, however this is a style that definitely will help sharpen your tools because it teaches you to practice test driven development (TDD) - so it definitely deserves to be included in this list. In the game of ping-pong there are two players who send the ball back and forth over a net. Comparatively speaking 1 developer would you write a failing test (ball over the net) for the next developer to pass, and once they've passed they switch roles(return to sender). In regards to honing your skills, there's nothing better than testing your knowledge. I personally however would avoid using this method during development of a project that would eventually get deployed versus using this method on practice projects.


As technology advances pair programming has become easier to implement remotely across many machines. Having tools like GitHub repositories and chat rooms like Zoom make it easy for programmers to work together in any method that they choose.Â  The most important thing is that you actually implement pair programming into your practices. Although there are some drawbacks like potentially having to wait on a developer to finish a certain portion of code before moving on, the benefits are endless. Faster development, learning experience, and even increased people skills. Working in group environments has also increased the ability to generate new ideas which is great in terms of innovation. I suspect that even pair programming will get more innovative in times to come.
