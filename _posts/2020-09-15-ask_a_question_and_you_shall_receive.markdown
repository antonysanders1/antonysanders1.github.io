    Utilizing all of your availalbe resources to get through a development challenge is a sure way to sharpen your skills as a developer. Getting started with my enrollment at Flatiorn School, I was introduced to a resource made available to all students called "Ask A Question". This resource allowed you to literaly ask a question to a group of alumni in real time and get helpful feedback. I don't know about you, but I thought this could be a pretty useful tool. So, why didn't I or my fellow classmates use it that often?

    Suprisingly It's a little more psychological than we think. Asking for help can often times make people feel uneasy because it requires surrendering control to someone else. People are hardwired to want to figure things out on their own and be independent-minded because we feel the need to have that sense of accomplishment, but this can quickly backfire.  Here's why: Being consistently productive in a work environment is a key to a person's success, but you can't be productive if you're stuck. 

    At Flatiorn we have an unofficial rule: *Spend no more than 30 minutes on attempting to find a solution on your own. If you can't figure it out, then Ask A Question.*  Although I liked the option to ask, I didn't see the true value of this rule as much when I started, but as I'm now preparing to gradute, I have one MAJOR TIP for futer students: Follow this rule at all costs!! 
		
		Frequently asking for help not only helps you stay productive, it also helps you learn HOW to ask the right questions. Often times we can't find solutions to our problems, because we aren'r asking the right questions. Story time: I once heard a software engineer say "I basically get paid to google things. I'm a master Googler". Story end. I note this because Googling is a lot like asking a question, except Google doesnt know your exact problem; it can only help you if you know how to ask the right questions!

    Unlike our friendly neighborhood 'web'-slinger *(Google)*, these alumni have the ability to assess your problem in real time and help you keep an eye out for the missing or broken pieces. Interestingly enough, asking the right questions is also a key component to acheiving success at work. If you practice this life changing habit now, I believe that landing that dream job gets one step closer.
		
		Thanks. Happy Coding!
